This project is basically a simple fashion website built as a task for masters level assignment at the university of Port Harcourt.
The sole aim of this was to demonstrate the ability to develop a website that users can interact with and possibly make an order of their favourite african wears both sewn ones and raw materials.

However, this is a static display of the website. Hopefully in the future if this could lead to more development in terms of adding more user feat and user experince capabilties as the owner wishes then we can build it as a web app using react.
